Although development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially improved
our understanding of the microbial ecology of animal feces, previous studies have
mostly focused on freshly excreted feces. There is still limited understanding of the
aging process dynamics of fecal microbiomes in intact cowpats exposed to natural
environments. Fresh cowpats were sampled at multiple time points for 57 days under
field conditions; half the samples were exposed to sunlight (unshaded) while the
other half was protected from sunlight (shaded). The 16SRNA hypervariable region
4 was amplified from each sample and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq Platform.
While Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Sphingobacteria were dominant classes of bacteria
in fresh cowpats, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacilli
were the dominant classes by the end of the study, indicating a general shift from
anaerobic to aerobic bacterial populations. This change was most likely influenced by
the shift from cattle gut (anaerobic) to pasture ground (aerobic). Reduced moisture in
cowpats may also contribute to the community shift since air can penetrate the dryer
cowpat more easily. Twelve genera consisting pathogenic bacteria were detected, with
Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Clostridium being the most abundant; their combined
abundance accounts for 90% of the total pathogenic genera. Taxonomic richness and
diversity increased throughout the study for most samples, which could be due to
bacteria regrowth and colonization of bacteria from the environment. In contrast to the
high taxonomic diversity, the changes of PICRUSt inferred function profile were minimal
for all cowpats throughout the study, which suggest that core functions predicted
by PICRUSt may be too conserved to distinguish differences between aerobe and
anaerobe. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that
cowpat exposure to air and sunlight can cause drastic microbiome changes soon
after deposition in natural environments. Our findings offer important insights for future
research characterizing the microbiome of feces collected in natural environments and
the impact of cattle fecal contamination on water resources.

INTRODUCTION
Fecal pollution of environmental waters is a major concern for
the public because exposure to fecal-associated pathogens can
have severe impacts on human health (Maier et al., 2008). Animal
shedding of feces is a major source of fecal contamination,
particularly in agricultural areas where animal manure is landapplied without prior treatment or where farm animals have
direct access to surface waters, as is the case for some animal
feeding operations. Detection of fecal indicators, source tracking
markers and pathogens using molecular techniques such as PCR
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) has increased substantially in the
last couple decades (Kong et al., 2002; Scott et al., 2002). In
addition, the recent adoption of next generation sequencing
(NGS) has facilitated greater characterization and understanding
of the composition and structure of the fecal microbiome
(Nakamura et al., 2009; Looft et al., 2012; McLellan et al.,
2013; Newton et al., 2013), which is critical to fecal pollution
detection as well as animal health and food safety (Shanks et al.,
2011).
A majority of metagenomic studies on fecal microbiomes
using NGS, focus on fresh feces (Unno et al., 2010; Shanks
et al., 2011; Looft et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2013; Ye and
Zhang, 2013). However, very little is known about how the
community structure of fecal bacteria changes after shedding into
the environment. Previous studies showed that the community
structure of fecal bacteria is sensitive to environmental stresses
induced by engineering and human intervention such as sewage
treatment, diet, antibiotic intake and nanoparticles exposure
(Looft et al., 2012; Ye and Zhang, 2013; Yang et al., 2014).
After animal shedding or land application of manure, natural
environmental stressors such as sunlight and moisture level
of feces strongly influence the survival of bacteria (Natvig
et al., 2002; Sinton et al., 2007; Oladeinde et al., 2014),
and can potentially influence the composition and ecology of
the fecal microbiome. Furthermore, previous survival studies
showed that different fecal bacteria have different re-growth
and decay patterns in the environment (Crane et al., 1980;
Davies et al., 1995; Oladeinde et al., 2014). Therefore, after
exposure of freshly excreted feces to the environment, the
abundance of different fecal bacterial groups is expected to vary.
There is very limited knowledge in this area and no study has
yet investigated the progressive change of the fecal bacterial
community structure resulting from exposure to environmental
conditions.
The main objectives of this study are to understand (i)
the progressive change of the community structure in freshly
excreted cowpats under field conditions and (ii) the impact
of sunlight exposure, with correlated changes in moisture
content, on the cowpat microbial community structure. Core
functional profiles and the abundance of genera consisting
of pathogenic genera are also included in this study. This
type of information will be very useful for future fecal
pollution research such as identification of better microbial
indicators and pathogen detection through the aging process.
We focus on cattle feces because agricultural activities and
livestock are the greatest contributors of fecal pollution

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Manure Collection, Study Site, and
Sample Collection
Detailed procedures for manure collection and study site
description can be found in Oladeinde et al. (2014). Briefly,
a total of eight freshly excreted bovine cowpats were used in
this study. One cowpat per cow, four cows per farm were
collected from two beef-producing farms in north Georgia during
the summer of 2012. Both farms were privately owned and
permissions to collect fecal samples were given by the owners
of the farms. Farm #1 was located in Jackson County, GA,
USA, while Farm #2 was located in Madison County, GA, USA.
Following excretion, cowpats were collected as whole as possible,
using 8-inch-diameter, 24-gage round-end stove caps (Grainger
Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) and a 24-inch × 12-inch piece of
sheet metal-gage steel (Stanley Hardware, New Britain, CT, USA).
The round stove cap end was placed carefully on the cowpat
to avoid disturbing its original structure as much as possible.
Cowpats were immediately transported on ice and in the dark
to the study site located at the US EPA Ecosystems Research
Division in Athens, GA, USA. Cowpat weights ranged from
0.7–1.6 kg (Supplementary Table 1). Two cowpats from each
farm were exposed to sunlight and two others were shaded by
placing a solid-color tarp over them. Plot covers (2.4 m × 1.7 m)
were constructed of PVC frames lined with clear acetate films
(Grafix Plastics, Cleveland, OH, USA; 80% UV-transmission)
and placed on top of each treatment set to protect the cowpats
from natural rain events. One additional cowpat was fitted
with a 12–Bit Smart temperature sensor connected to an onset
HOBO U30 data logger (Onset Computer Inc., Bourne, MA,
USA). A UV sensor (Satlantic model OCR-504) measuring four
different wavelengths (305, 325, 340, and 380 nm) was installed
underneath both treatment plot covers and connected to a Stor-X
data logger (Satlantic, Halifax, NS, Canada). One additional UV
sensor was installed away from the plot covers to monitor full
sunlight.
Four cores of fecal samples were collected on days 0, 2,
4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, and 57, between 9:00 and 10:00 am
from each cowpat; cores were collected from both the outer
crust and moist interior of the cowpat to obtain representative
samples of the entire cowpat. Cores sampled from each cowpat
were homogenized to yield a total of eighty samples (10
per cowpat) collected for sequencing analysis. The moisture
content of each homogenous fecal sample was determined
gravimetrically by drying 2–5 g at 105◦ C until equilibrium was
reached.

DNA Extraction
One hundred milligram of each homogenized cowpat sample
were transferred to PowerBead tubes in triplicate (MoBio
Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and stored at −80◦ C until
extraction, which occurred within 2 weeks of sampling. DNA

(Edgar et al., 2011). The final high quality reads were analyzed
using QIIME version 1.8.0 under default parameters (Caporaso
et al., 2010). The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking was
performed using UCLUST at a 3% threshold (Edgar, 2010) and
the OTUs with fewer than 10 reads were removed to avoid PCR
sequencing errors. OTU taxonomy was assigned by RDP 2.2 at a
confidence level cutoff of 80% (Wang et al., 2007). The relative
abundance (RA), as well as temperature and moisture reported
here, is the averaged RA of two cowpats. U1, U2 and S1, S2
are the abbreviations for unshaded (U) and shaded (S) samples
from Farm 1 and 2, respectively. Non-metric multidimensional
Scaling (NMDS) based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix
was performed using the R-VEGAN package in R1 to visualize
the community structure. Both replicate samples were plotted on
NMDS to visualize their structural differences. Once the iterative
NMDS solution is found, the R-VEGAN package uses a random
permutation method (“envfit”) for determining whether factors
and covariates are significantly influencing the NMDS scores. For
categorical factors (unshaded and shaded fecal samples), “envfit”
uses the difference between the average NMDS scores (centroids)
at each level of the factor. Since significant differences were found
among different factors (see “Results” section), envfit was also
used to determine if there is a significant difference between
two individual centroids. For a covariate (moisture), the test
compares the length of the fitted vector on the NMDS axes to
a distribution of fitted vector lengths calculated after randomly
permuting the dataset. Ten-thousand permutations were run to
construct the distributions of fitted vector lengths and factor-level
differences. We defined a p-value (p) less than 0.05 as a significant
difference for factors and covariates.
Alpha diversity analysis was calculated via a rarefaction curve
from QIIME’s alpha diversity pipeline (Caporaso et al., 2010).
Duplicate samples were combined and normalized to 10.5K
reads, which was equivalent to the sample with the least reads,
for estimating species richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon
index). Evenness was calculated by dividing the Shannon index
by the natural log of Chao1.
In addition to community structure analysis, Phylogenetic
Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved
States (PICRUSt) was also used to infer the functional content,
based on 16S OTU BIOM generated from QIIME (Langille et al.,
2013). The RA of PICRUSt inferred function is also reported here.
To determine significant differences in RAs, simple t-tests
were performed using R; a p-value (p) of ≤0.05 indicates a
significant difference.

was extracted using the MoBio Power-Soil DNA Isolation kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

PCR Amplification
Two sets of fusion primers were used: the first set generated
the primary 16S amplicons and the second converted
the primary amplicons into libraries for sequencing.
Primers targeting 16S rRNA hypervariable V4 region were
selected to capture the diversity of fecal-associated bacteria
(Forward: 50 -CAGCMGCCGCGGTAATWC-30 ; Reverse: 50 CCGTCAATTCCTTTRAGGTT-30 ; Lane et al., 1985). Forward
primers also contained the Illumina Nextera Read 1 sequence
(50 -TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-30 ),
whereas reverse primers had the Illumina Nextera Read 2
sequence (50 -GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGA
CAG-30 ). Unique sequence tags of varying lengths (5–8 nt)
were synthesized between the Nextera and 16S sequences
(Supplementary Table 2). Second round PCRs used iNext i5 (50 AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC NNNNNNNN
TCGTCGGCAGCGT∗ C-30 ) and iNext i7 (50 -CAAGCAGAA
GACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNNN GTCTCGTGGGCTCG∗
G-30 ) primers where the 8N’s are replaced by the specific tag
sequences given in Supplementary Table 2 and the ∗ designates a
phosphorothioate bond. A total of eight forward and 12 reverse
fusion primers were synthesized. For the first PCR round, three
independent 25 µl PCR reactions were run using the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 98◦ C for 30 s, and 22 cycles at
98◦ C for 7 s, 55◦ C for 30 s, 72◦ C for 15 s and a final extension
at 72◦ C for 7 min. To set up the second PCR, the triplicate PCR
reactions were combined and run using conditions similar to the
first round of reactions, except there were only 10 amplification
cycles. Each PCR reaction mix included 12.5 µL of 2X Phusion
High-Fidelity PCR master mix; 1.0 µL of each forward and
reverse primer (each final concentration was 400 nM); 8.5 µL of
PCR-grade water and 2 µL of DNA sample. The concentrations
of amplicons from different samples were normalized using
a SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). After normalization, all samples were pooled and
sequenced at the Georgia Genomics Facility using an Illumina
MiSeq v2 600 cycle kit. A 300 bps paired-end sequencing reaction
was performed on a MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA). PCR products of ∼550 bp (paired-end insert size) were
obtained for all 80 samples. Of the 550 bp, ∼400 bp represented
the 16S amplicons (including the primers). Seven samples with
few reads were resequenced. Reads were submitted to NCBI SRA
under accession SRP064539 and bioproject PRJNA297907.

Bioinformatics Analysis

RESULTS

Reads with a quality score less than 15 were trimmed
using fastq_quality_trimmer from the FASTX toolkit version
0.0.13.2 (FASTX-Toolkit, 2014). Forward and reverse barcode
combinations were used to identify each sample. Paired-end
reads were joined together using fastq-join from ea-utils.1.1.2537 (Aronesty, 2011), and unjoined reads were filtered out by
an in house script. SeqFilters.jar was used to extract sequences
between V4 region primers (Maidak et al., 1996), and chimeric
reads were filtered out using UCHIME with the “Gold” database

Moisture, UV Intensity, and Temperature
As expected, UV intensity and temperature of unshaded samples
was higher than shaded samples (Supplementary Figure 1). The
average UVA and UVB difference between unshaded and shaded
sites throughout the study was 1.94 ± 0.21 µW cm−2 and
40.20 ± 4.97 µW cm−2 , respectively. The temperature difference

between unshaded and shaded cowpats ranged from ∼2 to 5◦ C.
The moisture content of all samples was similar at day 0 and
slowly declined until day 8. U2 had a more rapid decline of
moisture content than other samples, at least 15% lower by day
8. From days 0 to 8, more rapid decline in moisture for U2
and S1 than U1 and S2 may be due to lighter average weights
of U2 and S1 (Supplementary Table 1). The duplicate cowpats
of S1 weighted very differently (Supplementary Table 1) but
their moisture levels were similar except on days 15 and 22
(Supplementary Figure 1), where the moisture levels of S1#1 were
60 and 55% higher than S1#2 on days 15 and 22, respectively.
After day 8, all samples experienced a rapid decline in moisture
content, but it was faster for unshaded samples. By the end of the
study, moisture content of unshaded samples was slightly lower
(∼5%) than in shaded samples. Moisture and sample day had a
significant inverse correlation based on linear regression analysis
(p < 0.05).

Bacteroidia was the major class of Bacteroidetes in day 0
cowpats (Figure 1), but experienced a gradual decline throughout
the study to a final RA of ≤ 0.5% (p < 0.05); in contrast, the
RA of Flavobacteria increased from day 2 to 8 especially in the
shaded cowpats. The RA of Actinobacteria for U1, S1, and S2 was
between 19 and 27% by day 57; however, it was more than 30%
for U2 by day 22 and close to 52% by day 57.
The RA of Alphaproteobacteria increased throughout the
study and it was the most prevalent Proteobacteria by day 57.
Even though the RA of Betaproteobacteria was higher than that of
the Alphaproteobacteria from day 2 to 6, the Betaproteobacteria
RA decreased gradually after day 8 and became lower than
the Alphaproteobacteria abundance in all cowpats by day 15.
Despite U1, S1, and S2 having similar RAs of Alphaproteobacteria
throughout the study, the RA of Alphaproteobacteria in U2
was lower than that of the other samples from day 15 to 57
and its abundance at day 57 was significantly lower than other
three samples (p < 0.05). The RAs of Gammaproteobacteria
and Deltaproteobacteria were lower (combined RA ≤ 3%) than
other Proteobacteria in unshaded cowpats, while they were more
abundant in shaded samples (combined RA ≥ 11%), especially
Gammaproteobacteria (RA ≥ 8%).
NMDS results were used to differentiate the community
structure of all eight individual cowpats at the class level as
illustrated in Figure 2A. Results indicate the trends of community
structure changes of duplicate samples throughout the study were
similar and majority of duplicate samples clustered together. At
day 0, the community structure of the four unshaded and the
four shaded samples grouped together. A continuous change of
community structure from days 2 to 8 can be inferred based on
all eight samples shifting toward the right side of the NMDS plot.
Despite the large difference in moisture levels of duplicate S1
cowpats on days 15 and 22, their community structure differences
on both days were minimal and they clustered together on NMDS
plot (Figure 2A). The distribution of samples from day 15 to
57 is illustrated with the centroid plots in Figure 2B. Both U2
centroids (purple centroids) are distinct from other centroids,
which is mainly due to the higher RA of Bacilli and Actinobacteria
and lower RA of Alphaproteobacteria relative to the other six
centroids. Despite the close proximity of duplicate centroids in
Figure 2B, the envfit analysis showed that all eight centroids are
significantly different from each other (p < 0.05), including the
four S1 and S2 centroids (p = 0.024). In addition, the length
of the fitted moisture vector is significantly greater than the
randomly permuted fitted moisture vector length, indicating that
sample points in NMDS space are significantly correlated to
moisture.

PCR Products and Illumina Sequences
Illumina MiSeq 300 PE sequencing of the 80 samples gave
a total of 8,842,490 reads. After fastq quality trimming, pairend joining, and barcode and chimeric filtering, 2,490,514 high
quality joined reads were obtained and used for downstream
analyses. Individual samples that passed QC generated 8.7–
43.5K reads. Samples that failed initial QC were re-sequenced,
generating 23–127K reads with average reads per sample being
64K. After clustering and taxonomic assignment with a 3%
cutoff, OTUs with less than 10 observation counts were removed.
Finally, the number of OTUs for individual samples ranged from
2.1 to 8.3K, with an average of 5.2K.

Composition of Bacterial Community at
Phylum and Class Level
Supplementary Figure 2 illustrates the RA of cowpats at the
phylum level. Throughout the entire study, Actinobacteria,
Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the major
phyla detected, with almost 90% of the bacteria assigned to
these phyla. The major phyla at day 0 were Firmicutes (44–
57%) and Bacteroidetes (35–49%), but their RA decreased to
<19% by day 57 (p < 0.05). In contrast, Actinobacteria and
Proteobacteria increased for both shaded and unshaded samples
over time, from less than 1% at day 0 to at least 65% by day
57. All four phyla had significantly different abundance in days
0 and 57 samples in both sets of shaded and unshaded samples
(p < 0.05).
The RAs at the class level of the four major phyla are illustrated
in Figure 1. The RA changes of two major classes of Firmicutes
are very different: Clostridia declined over time (from ≥44 to
≤3%) while Bacilli abundance increased significantly from days
0 to 2 in all samples (from ≤5 to ≥34%; p < 0.05). This increase
was followed by a gradual decrease after day 2 for a final RA of
≤6%. In contrast, the final RA of Bacilli was much higher for U2
(∼29%). The RA of Clostridia for S2 declined more gradually than
other cowpats but both shaded and unshaded samples ended with
≤3% of Clostridia by day 57, and became significantly lower than
day 0 (p < 0.05).

Family Compositions of
Alphaproteobacteria,
Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and

The RAs at the family level were used to further investigate the
community structure of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,

the end of the study.

abundances of two individual cowpats. “Others” includes all classes with less than 0.5% RA. NA, not assigned.

Members of the family Coriobacteriaceae were the most
dominant Actinobacteria at day 0; however, Coriobacteriaceae
RA decreased significantly in all samples after day 0 (p < 0.5;
Supplementary Figure 4). Nocardiaceae, Nocardioidaceae,
Mycobacteriaceae, and Patulibacteraceae became the dominant
families of Actinobacteria in all samples by day 57.
Unclassified Alphaproteobacteria and RF32 dominated
the Alphaproteobacteria communities in all samples (≥90%
of their combined RA) at day 0; however, the RA in all
samples significantly decreased to a range of ≤0.3% by
day 57 (p < 0.05; Supplementary Figure 4). The RA of
Sphingomonadaceae for all samples also increased after
day 0 but began to decrease by day 6, and the increase in
Sphingomonadaceae abundance was larger for unshaded samples.
Despite the difference between samples, Bradyrhizobiaceae,
Caulobacteraceae,
Hyphomicrobaceae,
Phyllobacteriaceae,
Rhizobiaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and unclassified Rhizobiales
became the dominant Alphaproteobacteria families in all

at the beginning of the study (Supplementary Figure 5).
Comamonadaceae and unclassified Burkholderiales were the
two most dominant groups at day 2 for all samples and the
community structure for shaded samples remained relatively
similar throughout the study. The RA of Alcaligenaceae, however,
gradually increased and eventually became the dominant
Betaproteobacteria family again in unshaded samples. The
RA of Oxalobacteraceae gradually increased in all samples
but more substantially in the unshaded samples. The RA of
Methylophilaceae increased only in shaded samples.
Planococcaceae was the most dominant Bacilli in all samples
during the study. The RA of Bacillaceae also remained stable
throughout the study. Paenibacillaceae increased substantially in
most samples (Supplementary Figure 6).

Composition of Pathogenic Bacteria at
Genus Level
Based on the previously reported genera consisting of pathogenic
fecal bacteria (Ye and Zhang, 2011), 12 genera were identified
in our samples; their total abundance throughout the entire
study varied from 1.6 to 4.9% (Supplementary Figure 7). Three

15 followed by a plateau phase, and decreased after day 29
(Figure 4). For U2, richness only increased from day 0 to 2
followed by a gradual decline until day 57. After day 0, S2
had the greatest increase in richness, while U2 exhibited the
smallest increase. The changes of richness for U1 and S1 were
relatively similar throughout the study. Except for U2, other
samples at day 57 had a higher richness than day 0. Shannon
diversity index decreased in all samples at the beginning of the
study with U2 having the greatest reduction (∼18%). For U1,
S1, and S2, the diversity increased substantially after day 4 and
it became 13 to 21% higher than day 0. For U2, the diversity
only increased slightly after day 4 and it remained at least 10%
lower than the diversity at day 0. Similar to diversity, the evenness
also declined at the beginning of the study with U2 having the
greatest reduction (∼23%). Overall, S2 has the greatest increase
of richness, diversity and evenness throughout the study, the
changes of these factors were similar between S1 and U1, and the
index values of these factors was the lowest for U2 throughout the
study.
The number of OTUs in the rarefaction curves with
a 3% cutoff did not level off by day 57 (Supplementary
Figure 9), indicating that additional sequencing depth is needed
for sufficient species coverage. At 5% cutoff (Supplementary
Figure 10), all samples still needed more sequence reads to reach
the plateau but sequence depth was almost sufficient for aged
(days 43 and 57) U2 samples. The number of OTUs continuously
increased from day 0 to day 15 in U1, S1, and S2 samples, but in
U2 samples, only days 2 and 4 had higher numbers of OTUs than
day 0.

Functional Analysis
The RA of PICRUSt inferred function is illustrated in Figure 5.
Compared to taxonomic profiles, the functional profiles of all
samples were much more similar to each other. Nevertheless, a
few functional changes were observed over time, regardless of
UV exposure or farm location. For instance, all cowpats had an
increase in the abundance of membrane transport and xenobiotic
biodegradation and metabolism but a decrease in the abundance
of translation, replication and repair, and cellular processes and
signaling throughout the study. Differences of all these functions
between days 0 and 57 were significant (p < 0.05). Amino
acid and carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport and
replication and repair were the most abundant functions in all
samples.
Since aerobic bacteria is more effective in generating energy
than anaerobic bacteria, different pathways in energy metabolism
were compared. The RA of energy metabolism and carbon
fixation at days 0 and 2 was significantly higher than the rest
of samples (p < 0.05), but no significant difference was found
between day 0 and day 2 samples (p > 0.05; Supplementary
Figure 11). The RA of methane metabolism at day 0 was
significantly higher than other samples (p < 0.05). There were
no significant difference in both nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms
among the samples collected at different dates (p > 0.05). The
mean RAs of energy metabolism, methane metabolism and
carbon fixation were reduced by 27, 27, and 13%, respectively,
between day 0 and day 57 samples.

genera, Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Clostridium, were the
most abundant; with a combined abundance of 90% of the
total pathogenic genera. Genera such as Mycobacterium had a
higher abundance in aged feces, but others such as Clostridium,
Streptococcus, and Treponema had higher abundance in fresh
feces (Figure 3). The presence of some genera was also treatmentspecific: Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, and Pseudomonas were
present more often in shaded samples than in unshaded.

Alpha Diversity Analysis
Because all four samples had different values of Chao1 (richness),
Shannon (diversity) and evenness at day 0 (Supplementary
Figure 8), the values from each sampling days were normalized
(Figure 4) by day 0 values to illustrate the relative changes
overtime. Overall U1, S1, and S2 richness increased up to day

the environment changes drastically within just 2 days. Two of
the most dominant classes of bacteria at day 0, Clostridia and
Bacteroidia are obligate anaerobes (Baron et al., 1996; Coyne
et al., 2013), and exhibit an initial combined RA of 86 to
90%, but their combined RA decreased to only 2 to 3% by
day 57. On the other hand, the RAs of Alphaproteobacteria,
Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria in all cowpats, Bacilli in
U2, and Gammaproteobacteria in shaded cowpats increased
throughout and/or by the end of the study. The family
members of Alphaproteobacteria that increased substantially
throughout the study are all aerobic bacteria and belong to
the Acetobacteraceae, Methylobacteriaceae, as well as four major
nitrogen fixing bacterial groups, Rhizobiaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae,
Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Phyllobacteriaceae (Ivanova et al., 2001;
Gallego et al., 2006; Greenberg et al., 2006; Clark et al.,
2009). The most dominant family of Actinobacteria at day 0,
Coriobacteriaceae (Harmsen et al., 2000), are obligate anaerobes.
In contrast, Nocardiaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Mycobacteriaceae,
and Microbacteriaceae are aerobes (Lechevalier et al., 1977;
Stackebrandt et al., 1997; Han et al., 2003) and were the four
most abundant Actinobacteria present by day 57. In addition,
Clostridia had a rapid decline in RA by day 2 while Bacilli,
which have the ability for aerobic respiration (Nazina et al.,
2001), increased substantially. Therefore, a major trend of the
fecal microbiome in this study for all samples is a community
structure shift from anaerobic to aerobic bacteria. Although this
observation has not been reported in previous studies to the best
of our knowledge, the microbiome results are consistent with
the large oxygen level difference between animal gut and open
field environment. Also, if diet, host origin and antibiotic usage
can influence the community structure of the fecal microbiome
(Unno et al., 2010; Shanks et al., 2011; Looft et al., 2012), why
wouldn’t microbiome change substantially when expose to an
environment with a completely different oxygen level?
We believe the reduction in moisture level in the cowpat
increased the exposure of cowpats to oxygen/air due to air being
able to diffuse more readily into the pore space of drier feces.
In addition, moisture is significantly correlated with sampling
date, and the directional change of the community structure is
significantly correlated to moisture based on the envfit analysis.
Therefore, moisture content of cowpats could be a factor
influencing the microbial diversity of feces deposited in the field
environment. However, we cannot argue that moisture is the only
important factor influencing community structure in all cases.
For instance, a minimal difference was identified in duplicate
S1 cowpats on day 15 and 22 while their moisture content was
drastically different. Since oxygen inside the cowpats was not
measured in this study, we recommend measuring this factor in
future studies to determine correlations between moisture and
oxygen level inside the cowpats, and between oxygen level and
abundance of the aerobe/anaerobe community.
Our data suggest that sunlight is affecting the microbial
diversity based on the fact that the community structures
differ between unshaded and shaded cowpats, especially those
collected at farm 2. Our previous study also showed that the
re-growth and decay pattern of different fecal indicators was
not the same in shaded and unshaded samples (Oladeinde

et al., 2014). Exposure to sunlight resulted in higher UV
intensity and temperature and faster loss of moisture content
in unshaded cowpats (Supplementary Figure 1); however, which
factor has more influence on community structures could not
be determined here. In addition, there is a greater separation
between the centroids of shaded and unshaded cowpats than
the centroids of duplicate cowpats in NMDS plots, indicating
that the differences between community structures of shaded
and unshaded samples by the end of the study were not
due to variation in duplicate samples and/or measurements

but were induced by sunlight. Also, considering the difference
between unshaded samples (U1, U2) is much greater than the
difference between shaded samples (S1, S2), it indicates that feces
from different farms under the sunlight exposure can result in
different microbial communities and therefore animal history
such as diet should also be taken into consideration. Previous
studies have shown that photodegradation of organic matter
can have significant impact on bacterial growth (Lindell et al.,
1995; Tranvik and Bertilsson, 2001; Fasching and Battin, 2012);
therefore, if the composition of organic matter in the feces from

Diversity is a function of richness and evenness. Because
evenness in all four samples increased to days 8 (U2) and 15
(U1, S1, S2) and stayed at plateau until day 29, no samples
during this period had a decline of diversity – even U2, whose
diversity remained relatively constant despite continuous decline
of richness. Richness, diversity, and evenness of all samples
began to decrease around day 29. A couple of possible reasons
may account for the increase of overall richness and diversity.
One possible reason is the growth of low abundance bacteria
to detectable levels, such as the re-growth of Proteobacteria
and Actinobacteria. Another possible reason is the colonization
of airborne bacteria from the field environment (e.g., from
surrounding soils) since cowpats were placed in the metal
containers with no top cover throughout the study. Evidence
of this is the fact that Nocardiaceae, commonly found in soils,
was one of the most dominant Actinobacteria families found
in our samples as the study progressed. Because no soil or air
samples were sequenced in this study, we do not know the level
of influence by surrounding soil bacteria on the community
structure of cowpats.
Based on the rarefaction curves from this and previous studies,
more sequence reads are needed for sufficient coverage for cattle
feces in future studies. Even with 80K reads, the rarefaction
curves for most cattle feces were not able to reach plateau at
3% cutoff (Shanks et al., 2011). Unno et al. (2010) and Jeong
et al. (2011) compared rarefaction curves of feces from different
animals and found both beef and dairy cattle feces had the highest
number of OTUs; rarefaction curves of cattle feces in both studies
were also not able to reach plateau at 3% cutoff.
There has been increased interest in identifying better
microbial signatures of fecal-associated samples, using NGS, to
improve water quality monitoring (Unno et al., 2010; Shanks
et al., 2011; Newton et al., 2013; Ye and Zhang, 2013).
Applications in these studies focused on identifying fecalassociated pathogens and fecal signature bacteria for microbial
source tracking. We believe the results reported here provide
useful insights for future studies in applying community analysis
to monitor and track fecal water pollution. The fecal microbiome
affecting surface water in the agricultural areas originates from
both fresh and aged feces, however, previous studies have
focused mostly on identifying the relationship between the
microbiome of polluted water and fresh feces. We therefore
believe they viewed the fecal microbiome, more or less, as
a “static” microbiome without recognizing possible dynamic
changes after feces are released from mammal gut into field
environment. Fecal pollution can easily be overlooked if only
microbiome information of fresh feces is used to identify the
pollution or its source.
Another major application of NGS to water quality is pathogen
detection. We were able to detect 13 genera consisting of
pathogenic bacterial species. Similarly to observations in phylum,
class, and family classification, the genera that are present
more abundantly in fresh/slightly aged feces (Clostridium,
Streptococcus, and Treponema) are anaerobe, but the genera
that is present more abundantly in aged feces (Mycobacterium)
are aerobe. In addition, Bacillus can be aerobic or facultative
anaerobic, and were detected in both fresh and aged feces.

different farms change after photodegradation, it can strongly
influence the growth and decay pattern of bacteria, thus affecting
the community structure.
This study showed that the RAs of certain bacterial
groups (e.g., Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria) did not exhibit the
monotonic trend that Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia did,
but instead their RAs increased initially and then decreased
(Figure 1), indicating that the environmental conditions favoring
the abundance of these bacteria changed over time. This could
be due to different fecal bacteria having different decay or regrowth rates in the environment and thus affecting the RA
of individual groups in the community (Crane et al., 1980;
Sinton et al., 2007; Oladeinde et al., 2014). For example, increase
of Bacilli abundance from days 0 to 2 in all samples can be
caused by an increase in the concentration of Bacilli, but also
could be due to a reduction in the abundance of Clostridia.
Future studies should determine if a change of RA correlates
to changes of absolute bacterial concentration by including
qPCR analysis for absolute quantification of different bacterial
groups.
Contrary to the high taxonomic changes observed in our
data, the RA of PICRUSt inferred functional profiles remained
fairly consistent throughout the study. A similar observation
was also reported in a human microbiome study where distinct
differences in taxonomic structure were found among the
samples collected from different body habitats, but the abundance
of metabolic pathways remained consistent among different
samples. A previous study used both shotgun metagenomics and
PICRUSt prediction to determine the core bacterial functions
from different Upper Mississippi River water samples, and results
from both approaches also showed that function profiles were
more consistent than the 16S taxonomic community profiles
(Staley et al., 2014). Such consistency could be due to different
bacteria having similar core functions, but it could also indicate
that the core functions predicted by PICRUSt are too conserved
to distinguish differences between aerobes and anaerobes. For
example, PICRUSt can only provide the abundance of methane
metabolisms, but there are four modes of methane metabolism
that include aerobic and anaerobic processes (Oremland, 2010).
Higher coverage using shotgun metagenomics may therefore be
needed to have a finer resolution of bacteria function profile such
as differentiating various methane metabolism modes.
A significant decrease in the energy metabolism function may
be due to shifting from an anaerobic to an aerobic bacterial
community. Decreased overall energy metabolism throughout
the study may be a results of the decrease of anaerobic
bacteria observed in our samples. A higher abundance of
energy metabolism function may be needed to sustain the
anaerobic community because energy production by anaerobe
is less efficient than by aerobe. Consistency in nitrogen and
sulfur metabolism throughout the study could be due to both
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria having these two metabolisms.
A significantly higher abundance of methane metabolism in
day 0 was most likely due to the present of methanogens
(Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera), which are anaerobic
bacteria and they were detected at day 0 samples more often than
other samples (data not shown).

Therefore, detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces and fecalimpacted water can be influenced by feces freshness. Our results
also show sunlight irradiation might reduce chances of pollution
due to certain bacterial pathogens such as the pathogenic species
in Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, and Pseudomonas. E. coli was
detected using qPCR in our previous study (Oladeinde et al.,
2014), however, no Escherichia was detected in this study, which
is likely due to the fact that our study did not have enough
reads covering all the genera since the rarefaction curves did
not plateau. To improve the reliability of using NGS for fecal
pathogen detection, it is therefore important for future studies to
determine numbers of reads required for covering all genera and
species in different fecal samples.
There has been increasing attention to study fecal microbiome
for different purposes, however, many of these studies do
not mention the level of freshness of fecal samples during
collection. Although our intention was not to investigate the
influence of the fecal sampling procedure on community
structure, results highlight importance of fecal sample freshness
because exposure to air and sunlight for even a short period
can have a significant impact on the fecal bacterial profile.
When studying factors such as diet, treatment received or
host origin on fecal microbiomes, it is important to collect
fresh samples to maintain integrity of the microbial community
structure as it exists in the feces before shedding. This is
emphasized by the large differences on the fecal bacterial
community structure observed between days 0 and 2. To gain a
better understanding of the lasting impact of fecal microbiome
on environmental/surface waters, it is important for future

research to cover a more comprehensive timeframe, without
losing perspective of the rapid changes occurring shortly after
deposition.
