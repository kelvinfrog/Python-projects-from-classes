we investigated the inﬂuence of inorganic
ions on the aggregation and deposition (adsorption) behavior of human
adenovirus (HAdV). Experiments were conducted to determine the
surface charge and size of HAdV and viral adsorption capacity of sand in
diﬀerent salt conditions. The interfacial potential energy was calculated
using extended Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek
(XDLVO) and steric hindrance theories to interpret the experimental
results. Results showed that diﬀerent compositions of inorganic ions
have minimal eﬀect on varying the iso-electric point pH (pHiep) of
HAdV (ranging from 3.5 to 4.0). Divalent cations neutralized/shielded
virus surface charge much more eﬀectively than monovalent cations at
pH above pHiep. Consequently, at neutral pH the presence of divalent
cations enhanced the aggregation of HAdV as well as its adsorption to
sand. Aggregation and adsorption behaviors generally agreed with XDLVO theory; however, in the case of minimal electrostatic
repulsion, steric force by virus’ ﬁbers can increase the energy barrier and distance of secondary minimum, resulting in limited
aggregation and deposition. Overall, our results indicated that subsurface water with low hardness residing in sandy soils may
have a higher potential of being contaminated by HAdV.

INTRODUCTION

Compared to bacteria and protozoa, viruses are smaller and
able to travel longer distances in the environment.16 Because of
their mobility,17 viruses have been selected as the biological
agent to model the transport of waterborne pathogens in
subsurface environments.18,19 Solution chemistry of environmental compartments can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the electro-kinetic
and size characteristics of suspended particles.20 These
properties signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the mobility, adsorption, and
removal of viruses.21 The Derjaguin and Landau and Verwey,
and Overbeek (DLVO) theory has been used to understand the
transport behavior of colloid particles, and it can also be applied
to study virus transport because of the similar size of viruses
and colloids.22 However, some studies found DLVO theory was
not able to predict deposition of viruses,23−25 and suggested
that steric hindrance arising from ﬁbers or longer loops can
signiﬁcantly reduce virus deposition.
Because of the potential public health risk caused by HAdV
and the lack of understanding of its transport behavior, the
objectives of this study were to investigate the inﬂuence of

Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are a common cause of
gastroenteritis,1,2 upper and lower respiratory system infections,
and conjunctivitis.3 Other diseases associated with HAdVs
include acute and chronic appendicitis, cystitis, exanthematous
disease, and nervous system diseases.3 HAdVs are also
considered to be important opportunistic pathogens in
immunocompromised patients.4
High prevalence of HAdV has been found in diﬀerent water
environments including marine, river, ground, drinking, recreational, and wastewaters.5−15 Wastewater eﬄuent samples from
diﬀerent sources tested positive for HAdV with a mean
concentration of 3.7 × 103 genome copies (GC)/L.12 Infectious
HAdV was also found in approximately 70% of biosolid
samples,13 and the mean genome concentration of HAdVs in
digested sludge was as high as fecal indicators such as
Escherichia coli and enterococci.14 HAdV was found in river
and lake water samples with a mean concentration of 101−104
GC/L.5,15 Considering its widespread presence and propensity
to cause adverse health impacts, HAdV has been included on
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s contaminant
candidate list one, two, and three in the year 1998, 2005, and
2007, respectively.

directly added to qPCR reaction mix without nucleic acid
extraction. We found that 95 °C for 15 min during the enzyme
activation step in the qPCR assay was enough to burst the virus
capsid and release the DNA for analysis. Standard curves were
generated by serial dilution of HAdV in liquid matrix with
suspended sand particles so that inhibition eﬀects of the
standards and experimental samples were the same, and any
diﬀerences in threshold value caused by inhibition would not
aﬀect viral quantiﬁcation accuracy. A standard curve was
generated for each salt condition since inorganic ions also can
aﬀect the threshold value in the qPCR reaction. The standard
curves for each condition are illustrated in SI Figure S2. The R2
values for all standard curves were above 0.99 and slopes
ranged from 3.41 to 3.48 (SI Figure S2). All viral
concentrations in the isotherm study were within the
concentration range of the standard curves. The qPCR assay
was adopted from Heim et al.27 and details of the reaction mix
and ampliﬁcation conditions are described in the SI.
Extended DLVO and Steric Interaction. The virus−virus
attachment (aggregation) and virus−sand attachment (deposition) are governed by interfacial potential energy. According to
extended DLVO theory (XDLVO), the surface potential energy
(ΦXDLVO) is calculated by the sum of potential energy
contributed by van der Waals (ΦvdW), electrostatic double
layer (ΦEdI), and hydrophobic interactions (Φhydrophobic).28 In
addition, previous studies have suggested that steric interactions
(ΦSteric) could have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the attachment
behavior of viruses or bacteria;29,30 therefore, steric energy is
added to the XDLVO energies to calculate the total interaction
energy:

solution chemistryinorganic ion concentrations and composition, and pHon the colloidal properties and adsorption
characteristics of HAdV. In addition, the interfacial potential
energies of virus−virus and virus−sand were calculated using
extended Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek
(XDLVO) and steric hindrance theories to interpret the
aggregation and adsorption results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of HAdV. HAdV serotype 2 (strain 6) was
obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA)
and propagated in A549 cells; viruses were then puriﬁed
according to the procedure described in Tollefson et al.26 The
concentration of puriﬁed virus determined by plaque assay was
about 107 PFU/mL. Detailed procedures for virus propagation
and plaque assay are described in the Supporting Information
(SI).
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). TEM images
were taken to determine the size of HAdV used in this study.
Approximately 10−20 drops of the viral suspension were
droppered, one at a time, onto a carbon-coated Formvar grid of
400-mesh and later stained with 3% aqueous phosphotungistic
acid, pH 7.0. The grid was then dried in a desiccator and TEM
images were acquired using JEM-1210 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan),
coupled with a XR41C Bottom-Mount CCD Camera (AMT,
Danvers, MA).
Zeta Potential Measurement of Adenovirus in Diﬀerent pH and Salt Conditions. Eﬀect of inorganic salt
composition and concentration on the zeta potential (ZP) of
HAdV at diﬀerent pH values was investigated. The ZP was
measured under a range of pH (∼3 to ∼10) in the following
ﬁve conditions: 1 mM NaCl; 10 mM NaCl; 7 mM NaCl and 1
mM CaCl2; 1 mM NaCl and 3 mM CaCl2; 1 mM NaCl and 3
mM Na2SO4. All ﬁve matrices have an ionic strength (IS) of 10
mM except for 1 mM NaCl. NaOH and H2SO4 were used to
adjust the pH. Each ZP value is the average of four repeated
measurements.
Virus Aggregation Studies. Eﬀects of pH, salt concentration and inorganic ion composition on the aggregation of
HAdV were investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS)
to measure hydrodynamic diameter (DH) changes. The
following solution chemistries were used for the aggregation
study: 1 and 100 mM of NaCl at three diﬀerent pH (4, 7, and
10); 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 5.0, and 50 mM of CaCl2 and of
MgCl2 at ∼pH 7.5. The ZP measurements were also made
under these conditions. Detailed procedures for ZP and DLS
measurements are described in the SI. Each DH value is the
average of 10 repeated measurements.
Isotherm Experiment. Batch adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted to evaluate adsorption of the virus to
sand particles. Experiments were conducted in glass tubes with
three diﬀerent inorganic ion compositions but the same IS: 10
mM NaCl; 7 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2; 1 mM NaCl and 3
mM CaCl2. Acid-washed Ottawa sand (EMD, SX0070-3) with
a particle size of 30−40 mesh was used as the adsorbent. The
experiment was performed in duplicate. Detailed procedures for
isotherm experiments are described in the SI.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Analysis. qPCR was used to
quantify viral particles during the isotherm experiments. High
variations in DNA extraction recovery can potentially create
signiﬁcant errors in calculating virus distribution between liquid
and solid phase, thus aﬀecting the accuracy of the isotherm
curve. Therefore, liquid phase samples and standards were

hydration layer thickness can be observed during DLS
measurement, it fails to show up in TEM analysis because of
low electron-density in that region. Additionally, the Stokes−
Einstein equation is used in DLS measurement to determine
the particle size and it assumes that all the particles are spheres.
Therefore, ﬁbers (∼31 nm) attached to the HAdV capsid can
be regarded as virus surface and increase the DLS measurement. Finally, since DLS depends on light scattering for size
estimation and light scattering varies with the sixth power of the
particle diameter,20 the presence of a few virus aggregates in the
suspension can skew overall virus size distribution toward the
larger-size. Nevertheless, the mean polydispersivity index (PDI)
for the DLS measurements was found to be ≤0.25, indicating
that the viruses in the stock suspension were nearly
monodispersed.23

where θ1 and θ2 are the water contact angle of virus and sand,

lack of instrument and information in the literature, the contact
angle of HAdV is not available for this study. Constants and
contact angles to calculate the hydrophobicity interaction
between HAdV and sand were adopted from a previous study
on the interaction between MS2 and sand.32 MS2 was selected
because it has a higher hydrophobicity than other two viruses:
ΦX174 and Aichivirus.

on the ZP of HAdV. As expected, ZP became more positive as
pH decreased, due to protonation of the negative functional
groups on the virus surface. Ionic strength is a combined eﬀect
of counter- and co-ions and is responsible for compressing the
electrostatic double layer (EDL) around colloids (in our case,
HAdV). However, only the counterions (in our case, Na+ and
Ca2+) shielded the negative charge on the surface and caused a
decrease in the absolute ZP (|ZP|). As observed in other
studies,20,36 charge shielding is more eﬀective in the presence of
higher valence counterions and higher concentration of
counterions, which explains the observed variation trends in
ZP shown in Figure 1. At pH > 4, the presence of CaCl2
decreased the |ZP| more than other conditions with the same IS
but no Ca2+. The decrease of |ZP| was higher at 10 mM than 1
mM NaCl (pH > 6), and at 3 mM than 1 mM CaCl2 (pH > 4).
Like counterions, co-ions can play a signiﬁcant role in
aﬀecting the surface charges of colloids. Because of their smaller
hydrated radius, co-ions can approach and get adsorbed to
similar-charged surfaces37 and cause an overall increase in |ZP|.
Such preferential adsorption of co-ions is also possible on virus
surfaces and may aﬀect surface charge. At pH > 8, the ZP of
HAdV was found to be more negative in the presence of SO42‑
than when just Cl− was present (Figure 1); this is because each
SO42‑ carries two negative charges while each Cl− carries only
one negative charge. Preferential adsorption of co-ions has been
reported by another study of nanoparticles in aqueous
systems.20

Statistical Analysis. To determine whether diﬀerent
conditions can cause signiﬁcant changes in the ZP and DH of
HAdV, analysis of variance (ANOVA) single tests were
performed using Sigma Plot 11.0; a p-value of ≤0.05 indicates
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Size Characterization of Adenovirus. SI Figure S3 is the
TEM image of puriﬁed HAdV; the size of HAdV determined by
TEM was about 70 nm, which is similar to previously reported
values.34 The image showed that the virus structure remained
intact with no apparent damage during the puriﬁcation and
TEM preparation procedure. The DH of HAdV in the storage
buﬀer (pH 5.9, 1 mM NaCl), determined by DLS, was ∼120
nm. Size variation with diﬀerent measurement methods has
been reported previously, and TEM measurement values have
always been found to be lower than DLS results.23,35 One
possible explanation might be the formation of the hydration
layer at the virus surface water interface.23 Although the

and DH of MS2 decreased from ∼1500 to ∼1100 nm when the
concentration of NaNO3 increased from 1 mM to 100 mM at
pH 4, near the pHiep of MS2.52 One explanation could be that
ﬁbers at both pHiep and high salt conditions can roll back and
lie in parallel conformation to the virus capsid reducing the
overall free energy of the virus particle, the same mechanism
causing micelle and hemimicelle formation.53 We believe that
DH measurements can be reduced by rolling back ﬁbers, but
more in-depth investigation is needed to identify and conﬁrm
the speciﬁc mechanism causing lower DH in the presence of
higher salt concentration at pHiep.
Our results indicate that adjusting the solution pH to pHiep
has a stronger eﬀect on virus aggregation than increasing the
monovalent cation concentration. As noted in Figure 2, the DH
increased signiﬁcantly (p ≤ 0.05) as the pH approached pH 4.
By lowering pH value from 10 to 4, the DH increased from 90
to 300 nm at 1 mM NaCl, and from 125 to 200 nm at 100 mM
NaCl. Colloids tend to aggregate as the pH approaches pHiep
because the energy barrier preventing aggregation disappears
(see discussion of XDLVO Theory and Steric Eﬀect).
Conversely, the further from pHiep, greater stability of the
suspended colloids is expected. Thus, like other colloids, the
pHiep of HAdV plays a signiﬁcant role in determining its ability
to interact with other surfaces in its vicinity.
Eﬀect of Divalent Cation on Aggregation. The eﬀects
of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) on HAdV aggregation were
determined under low (0.1−1.0 mM) and high (5−50 mM)
salt concentrations around neutral pH (7.5). At the low salt
concentration, the |ZP| of HAdV decreased from ∼25 to ∼18
mV (Figure 3a) as salt concentration increased from 0.1 to 1.0
mM. No aggregation was observed and the DH did not vary
signiﬁcantly with salt type (p ≥ 0.05) (Figure 3a). However, the
DH of HAdV signiﬁcantly increased (p ≤ 0.05) when the

The iso-electric point pH (pHiep) of HAdV (Figure 1) was in
the range of 3.5−4.0 and varied minimally with diﬀerent
solution chemistry and IS; this indicates that none of the
cations or anions became speciﬁcally associated on the virus
surfaces and therefore interacted reversibly.38 These observations are similar to previous studies showing that the pHiep of
bacteriophage and pathogenic bacteria varied slightly with
diﬀerent IS and inorganic ion composition.39−41 Only a few
studies have reported the pHiep of HAdV: the pHiep of HAdV
serotypes 4 and 5 were reported as 2.6 and 4.5, respectively.42,43
Favier et al.44 predicted the pHiep of diﬀerent serotypes of
HAdV, based on external structural protein; however, none of
the pHiep values closely match the experimental pHiep values
measured by our and other studies.42,43 Based on the review by
Michen and Graule,45 the pHiep of most microorganisms is in
the range of 3.5−7.0, and our study showed the pHiep of HAdV2 is within this range. Two types of bacteriophage, MS2 and
ΦX174, have been widely used as the enteric virus surrogates to
study virus transport.46−49 Studies reported the pHiep of MS2 to
be around 3.0 to 4.1, while most of the pHiep of ΦX174 are
between 6.0 and 7.0.45,50 Considering the similarity in pHiep,
MS2 may be a more representative surrogate than ΦX174 to
predict transport behavior of HAdV in the environment.
Eﬀect of Monovalent Cation (Na+) and pH on
Aggregation. Figure 2 shows the eﬀect of NaCl concentration

and pH on the size of HAdV. The DH at 100 mM was
signiﬁcantly larger than at 1 mM NaCl at both pH 7 and 10 (p
≤ 0.05). This aggregation was due to the presence of Na+
which caused surface charge neutralization. However, the eﬀect
of Na+ on viral aggregation was minimal since the DH increased
by only ∼30 nm in the presence of higher Na+ concentrations.
Previous studies also suggested that monovalent cations have
little or no eﬀect on virus aggregation even though the
concentration was equal to and/or greater than 1 M.39,41,51
Over a pH range from 2 to 7, MS2 did not aggregate when the
background salt concentration of NaNO3 and NaHCO3 was
increased from 1 mM to 100 mM.39,41 No aggregation of
norovirus (NoV)-GII was observed with an increase in NaCl
concentration from 1 mM to 1000 mM.51
Interestingly, the DH at pH 4 in 100 mM NaCl was lower,
compared to 1 mM NaCl (p < 0.05) (Figure 2). Similar results
were observed by others:51,52 da Silva et al.51 noted that DH of
norovirus was larger at lower salt concentration of some pHs,

not statistically signiﬁcant (P > 0.05). Though not statistically
signiﬁcant at 95% conﬁdence interval, the increasing trend of
KF within minimal change in Ca2+ indicates that the presence of
higher concentration of Ca2+ can enhance adsorption of virus
on sand particles. The same explanation of why viruses
aggregated with the presence of Ca2+ applies in the case of
adsorption behavior of viruses to sand particles, where
electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces becomes attenuated
as |ZP| approaches zero and divalent cations have stronger
inﬂuence than monovalent cations on both viral aggregation
and deposition on the sand surface.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to
investigate the adsorption of HAdV to sand particles. Previous
studies found that the adsorption capacity of bacteriophages
(MS2 and ΦX174) on Ottawa sand particles in phosphate
buﬀered saline (PBS) was very low, with KF ranging from 0 to
0.44.16,47,58 Those results are similar to what we observed with
HAdV since PBS is composed of monovalent cation salts, and
neither the previous studies nor ours observed signiﬁcant
adsorption of viruses to sand particles when only the
monovalent cation is present. In another isotherm study, the
adsorption capacity of poliovirus by Ottawa sand in the
presence of 1 mM Ca2+ was 505,59 indicating the positive
inﬂuence of divalent cation on virus adsorption. It should be
noted that the HAdV adsorption capacity by silt−clay−loam
soils in PBS found in our other study60 was around 103, much
higher than the values reported here, suggesting that adsorption
of HAdV to pure sand particles can be relatively insigniﬁcant
compared to silt and clay. Modiﬁcation of sand surface such as
by metal oxide coating,61 however, can signiﬁcantly increase the
adsorption capacity.
Interpretation of Aggregation and Adsorption Results by XDLVO Theory and Steric Eﬀect. The virus−virus
and virus−sand interaction energy proﬁles are illustrated in
Figure 5. Aggregation and adsorption results generally agree
with the XDLVO theory, while smaller DH and lower
adsorption capacity are mostly associated with higher energy
barriers. The hydrophobic interaction had no signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the energy proﬁle since we did not see any diﬀerence in the
energy proﬁle of classic and extended DLVO theories (data not
shown). For virus−virus interaction, no energy barrier under 50
mM CaCl2 (Figure 5a) and 50 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM NaCl
(SI Figure S4) was observed; however, virus aggregation was
minimal compared to other nanoparticle studies20 where the
aggregation increased several fold when the energy barrier was
absent. To interpret further, steric interaction energy
contributed by osmotic and elastic repulsive force from the
virus’s ﬁbers was added to other XDLVO energies (Figure 5b).
Results showed that steric interaction increased the attachment
hindrance slightly. Equations 7 and 8 determined only the steric
force from the attaching particle, not the attached surface;
therefore, the actual maximum energy barrier should be higher
than the one shown in Figure 5b. Also, the eﬀect of steric forces
was estimated from certain assumptions and values from the
literature, which might or might not represent the true values in
the case of HAdV.
The eﬀects of steric force on the interaction energy between
virus and sand particle are illustrated in Figures 5c−e. Steric
interaction increased the maximum energy barrier and reduced
the distance of secondary minimum. Even though steric
interactions contributed the same amount of energy (around
1kBT) to the maximum energy barrier in all three conditions, it
had diﬀerent eﬀects on the distance of secondary minimum,

concentration of divalent cations increased from 5 to 50 mM
(Figure 3b). At neutral pH, the DH of HAdV in 50 mM CaCl2
and MgCl2 was larger than (p ≤ 0.05) and equal to (p ≥ 0.05)
the DH in100 mM NaCl, respectively. These results indicate
that aggregation kinetics of HAdV are more sensitive to
divalent than monovalent counterions because divalent
counterions are more eﬀective than monovalent ions in charge
shielding and shrinking the EDL;37 additionally, divalent ions
are also able to coagulate by bridging colloidal particles via
speciﬁc interactions and/or complexation.36,51
The DH signiﬁcantly increased (p ≤ 0.05) when the MgCl2
concentration was increased from 5 mM to 50 mM, but not
when CaCl2 was used as the background salt (p ≥ 0.05).
However, the DH of HAdV in both 5 and 50 mM of CaCl2 were
signiﬁcantly larger than in either 5 or 50 mM of MgCl2 (p ≤
0.05). In addition, |ZP| values of HAdV in 5 and 50 mM of
CaCl2 were signiﬁcantly lower than those in the same
concentrations of MgCl2 (p ≤ 0.05). Similar results were
observed by others, where Ca2+ had a stronger eﬀect than Mg2+
on aggregation of rotavirus23 and MS2.24 Authors of both cited
studies suggested that these eﬀects might be due to the ability
of Ca2+ to form bridges across the carboxylate groups on the
virus capsid more easily than Mg2+ because the ionic radius of
Mg2+ is larger. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid are the amino
acids containing carboxylate moieties35,54,55 and both are
present in the capsid of HAdV.56 Thus, larger aggregates of
HAdV in CaCl2 than in MgCl2 solution could be due to
stronger cation-bridging by Ca2+.
Based on our results and the fact that the concentration of
HAdV in the environment is usually lower than the
concentrations used in this study and the natural organic
matter can stabilize the virus,57 we anticipate that there will be
minimal aggregated forms of HAdV in freshwater environments, where the matrix is usually at neutral pH and low IS.

concentrations. No isotherm curve for 10 mM NaCl was
reported since the viral concentration in the liquid phase after
the isotherm experiments was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
the initial concentration, indicating that no adsorption of HAdV
to sand particles occurred. The Freundlich constant (KF)
increased slightly from 18 to 40 by increasing the concentration
of Ca2+ from 1 mM to 3 mM, but the increase in the constant is

conﬁdence interval. Finally, the removal of viruses could be
higher in the column setting since the tumbling and
centrifugation processes could obviate the attachment force at
secondary minimum force and straining during column
ﬁltration could also contribute a signiﬁcant amount of viral
removal.62
Interpretation of the eﬀect of virus aggregation and
adsorption mechanism inﬂuenced by solution chemistry can
be complicated. Based on observations in this study,
interpretation that relies solely on XDLVO theory may be
adequate when a high maximum energy barrier is present, but
steric hindrance and cationic bridging should also be
considered in conditions where a maximum energy barrier is
absent or extremely low.
Environmental Application. In summary, this study
provides initial ﬁndings on the inﬂuence of inorganic ions on
human adenovirus surface charge, isoelectric point, and
aggregation and deposition behavior. Based on our results,

where weak and reversible attachment takes place. After
incorporating the steric interaction, the distance of secondary
minimum increased by approximately 2, 5, and 9 nm in the
conditions of 10 mM NaCl, 7 mM NaCl/1 mM CaCl2, and 1
mM NaCl/3 mM CaCl2, respectively. Thus, even though the
distance of the secondary minimum computed by XDLVO
theory in these three solution conditions varied from 18 to 26
nm, their diﬀerence by XDLVO + steric was reduced to 1 nm
(ranging from 26 to 27 nm). These results indicate that steric
eﬀects not only hindered the attachment between virus and
sand particles, but can also be a controlling factor in reversible/
weak adsorption. Since the distances of secondary minimum by
XDLOV+steric are very similar in all three conditions, higher
viral adsorption capacity by sand particles in the presence of
higher Ca2+ concentration is likely a result of a lower maximum
energy barrier and the bridging eﬀect by divalent cation
discussed earlier. Additionally, the small decrease of maximum
energy barrier from 1 to 3 mM of CaCl2 could be the reason
why the increase in the adsorption capacity (or Freundlich

HAdV is likely to remain suspended as an individual virus in a
fresh water environment with low turbidity and neutral pH. If
the environment is composed of mostly sandy soils without
metal oxide coating (e.g., AlOH3, FeOH3) and under the water
conditions described above, HAdV can potentially be transported longer distances. On the other hand, a high salinity
environment such as seawater should neutralize or reverse the
surface charge of HAdV and enhance its attachment to solid
particulates.
Katayama et al.63 developed a viral sampling method using a
negatively charged membrane. Since this method is based on
electrostatic interaction, not entrapment, a divalent cation such
as MgCl2 was added to the water sample before sample
ﬁltration to reverse the virus surface charge to positive. This
study showed that adjusting the water pH to pHiep aggregates
HAdV more signiﬁcantly than adding the divalent cation;
therefore, further studies involving the sampling of HAdV by
negatively charged-membranes can consider including an
additional step of adjusting water pH to around the pHiep of
HAdV since larger viral aggregates can potentially be entrapped
more eﬃciently on the ﬁlter, thus increasing recovery. In
addition, replacing MgCl2 with CaCl2 may enhance the
attachment of virus to the ﬁlter membrane. However, stronger
attachment to the ﬁlter may not guarantee higher recovery
since recovery is a combination of viral attachment to and
detachment from the ﬁlter; an extremely strong attachment
may result in a low number of virus particles eluted from the
ﬁlter.64

Virus stock preparation and plaque assay. HAdV2 (strain 6) was propagated in A549
cells. A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing
10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and100 µg/mL of streptomycin. Cell monolayers in T150
flasks were infected at ~10 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Flasks were incubated at 37 °C and
5% CO2 and rocked every 15 minutes for 1 hour. After the adsorption period, the viral inoculum
was removed. Forty milliliters of maintenance medium containing 2% FBS were added and
flasks were incubated for ~72 hours. Stocks were frozen in the culture flasks at -70 °C.
To prepare purified HAdV for zeta potential (ZP) and size measurement, procedures
described in Tollefson et al. [1] were followed. Infected flasks were frozen and thawed three
times. Culture media was transferred to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 12,000 x g at 4 oC
for 10 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatant was kept. The volume of the supernatant
was determined and multiplied by 0.51; the resulting number was the number of grams of cesium
chloride (CsCl) to be added to the virus media. After mixing with CsCl, samples were transferred
to Ti50 quick-seal tubes and ultracentrifuged at 110,000g at 4 oC for 16 to 20 hours to band the
virus: the band appeared at approximately the middle of the tube. The virus was collected by
syringe puncture. Finally, diafiltration with 1m MNaCl was performed using 100 kDa Amicon
filters (Millipore) to remove the nutrient and CsCl.
Viral titers were determined via plaque assay by inoculating 0.25 ml of serial 10-fold
dilutions onto cell monolayers in 60 mm2 dishes. After a 1 hour adsorption at 37 ºC and 5%
CO2, the infected cells were overlaid with 5 ml maintenance medium (2X) containing 0.5%
agarose. Following a 5-day incubation, a second overlay containing 2% neutral red was added

and plaques were counted after 24 hours. The concentration of purified virus determined by
plaque assay was about 107 PFU/ml.

Preparation of solution with suspended sand particles. Solutions with suspended fine
sand particles were used as the liquid phase for preparing controls in adsorption isotherm
experiments, preparing HAdV quantification standard curves, and measuring zeta potential (ZP)
of sand. Salt solutions were added to sand at a 1:10 sand/liquid ratio, and then tumbled for 3
hours. Large sand particles were settled for 5 minutes, centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 minutes,
and the supernatant was the solution with suspended fine sand particles. The procedure described
above without the centrifugation was used to prepare the sample for measuring the ZP of sand
particles.

Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential methodology. The size and ZP of HAdV were
measured using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instrument Inc., UK) at 25oC. The virus
concentration used for both size and ZP analyses was around 107 PFU/ml. The intensity-based
average (z-average) hydrodynamic diameter (DH) was obtained, using dynamic light scattering
(DLS). In DLS, the dynamic variation in the scattered light intensity, due to the Brownian
motion of the dispersed particles, was recorded to estimate the intensity-weighted average
diffusion coefficient of the suspended viruses. This information was used to calculate DH with
the Stokes-Einstein equation. The size of virus measured at time zero was compared to the size
after 15 minutes of DLS measurement, or when no further changes in size were observed. After
the readings stablized, ten measurements were taken and recorded.
The phase analysis light scattering (PALS) technique was employed for ZP measurement. In
PALS, the phase shift of light scattered, due to movement of particles under an applied electric
field, was measured. This information was used to obtain particle velocity, also known as
electrophoretic mobility (µE), which is proportional to the degree of phase shifting of the
scattered light. The Smoluchowski equation was then used to calculate ZP from µE information.
NIST-traceable latex microsphere and polystyrene microsphere standards were used to verify
instrument performance.

Procedure of isotherm experiment. To conduct this experiment, 15 mL of viral suspension
was added to 1.5 grams of sand, then tumbled for 3 hours. Four different concentrations of viral
suspension (ranging from 103 to 106 PFU/ml) were used. The tumbling period was selected based
on experiments showing that the fractions of virus remaining in liquid phase after tumbling with
sand for 3, 9 and 21 hours were not significantly different (P ≥ 0.05) in all three salt conditions
(Figure S1), indicating that steady state was reached after 3 hours. After tumbling, large sand
particles were settled for 5 minutes; the liquid phase was transferred to a 1.7 ml plastic centrifuge
tube and centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 minutes. Four micro-liters of supernatant were used for
qPCR analysis. The pH of supernatant ranged from 6.2 to 6.5. Controls containing only viruses
and suspended sand particles were used to monitor virus inactivation, virus sorption to the glass
tube and PCR inhibition due to suspended sand particles. The detailed procedure for control
preparation was described in the “preparation of solution with suspended sand particles” section
in this supporting document. Control tubes were treated in the same manner as experimental
tubes. The mass balance equation for computing virus in the solid phase is described by:

C S  C I  C L  / M

[2]

where CI, CL, and CS are, respectively, the concentrations of virus in the control liquid phase
(virus equivalent unit (VEU)/ml), in the experimental liquid phase (VEU/ml), and in the solid
phase (VEU/gram) and M is the total mass of solid per unit volume of virus suspension (grams
per ml) used in each batch experiment.
The data was fitted to the logarithmic form of the Freundlich equation:

log C S  log K F  N log C L [3]
where KF is the Freundlich constant, and N is the slope of the plot of log CS vs. log CL.

Reaction mix, amplification condition and standard curve. The primers and probe for
quantification of HAdV were adopted from Heim et al [2]. Each qPCR reaction mix included 10
µL of 2X Universal TaqMan Master Mix (Applied Biosystems); 1.0 µL of each forward and
reverse primer (each final concentration was 500 nM); 0.6 µL of 10 µM TaqMan probe (final
concentration 300 nM); 3.7 µL of PCR-grade water and 4 µL of DNA sample or standard. The
real-time PCR running program was 95°C for 15 minutes followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 3
sec; 55°C for 10 sec; 65°C for 60 sec. The fluorescent signal was detected after each extension
cycle.
qPCR threshold (Ct) values were plotted against log viral concentrations in each standard
curve (Figure S2). The standards were generated by serial 10-fold dilution of HAdV culture in
salt solutions with suspended fine sand particles. The viral concentration of the stocks used for
preparing the standards was determined by plaque assay. Viral concentrations of the standards
were calculated according to the dilution. The Ct values of the standards were determined by
qPCR.

Each capsid of human adenovirus (HAdV) has 12 penton bases and each base is attached to
one fiber [9]. Since each fiber is composed of 584 amino acids [10], and the average molecular
weight of amino acid is ~110 g/mole [11], the molecular weight of fiber is calculated as 64
kg/mole. The maximum surface concentration is calculated as the mass of 12 fibers divided by
the surface area of the virus (4πr2), resulting in the values in Table S3. The volume fraction of
fiber was calculated using Equation [9] described in the manuscript.
