The most common class B biosolids in the United States are generated by mesophilic anaerobic
digestion (MAD), and MAD biosolids have been used for land application. However, the pathogen levels
in MAD biosolids are still unclear, especially with respect to enteric viruses. In this study, we determined
the occurrence and the quantitative levels of enteric viruses and indicators in 12 MAD biosolid samples
and of Salmonella enterica in 6 MAD biosolid samples. Three dewatered biosolid samples were also
included in this study for purposes of comparison. Human adenoviruses (HAdV) had the highest gene
levels and were detected more frequently than other enteric viruses. The gene levels of noroviruses (NV)
reported were comparable to those of enteroviruses (EV) and human polyomaviruses (HPyV). The occurrence percentages of HAdV, HAdV species F, EV, NV GI, NV GII, and HPyV in MAD samples were 83, 83,
42, 50, 75, and 58%, respectively. No hepatitis A virus was detected. Infectious HAdV was detected more
frequently than infectious EV, and all infectious HAdV were detected when samples were propagated in
A549 cells. Based on most-probable-number (MPN) analysis, A549 cells were more susceptible to biosolidassociated viruses than BGM cells. All indicator levels in MAD biosolids were approximately 104 MPN or
PFU per gram (dry), and the dewatered biosolids had significantly higher indicator levels than the MAD
biosolids. Only two MAD samples tested positive for Salmonella enterica, where the concentration was
below 1.0 MPN/4 g. This study provides a broad comparison of the prevalence of different enteric viruses
in MAD biosolids and reports the first detection of noroviruses in class B biosolids. The observed high
quantitative and infectivity levels of adenoviruses in MAD biosolids indicate that adenovirus is a good
indicator for the evaluation of sludge treatment efficiency.
hepatitis A virus (HAV) and noroviruses (NV). Also, only one
or two types of enteric viruses were quantified in the previous
studies; therefore, it is hard to determine and compare the
prevalence of different types of enteric virus in biosolids, since
the samples and sample processing methods varied from study
to study. A few studies focused on the viral infectivity of biosolids, and the results showed that infectious astrovirus and
enteroviruses were still present in the treated biosolids (9, 18,
42). However, no results on the occurrence of adenoviruses in
biosolids have been reported.
PCR techniques have been used in most of the recent environmental virology studies. In comparing these techniques to
cell culture, the main advantages of PCR methods for virus
detection are fast results, less labor intensiveness, high specificity and sensitivity, and the capability of detecting difficultto-culture or nonculturable viruses (for examples, human noroviruses and adenovirus 40/41). Quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR), which is considered the latest advancement in PCR
technology, can provide both qualitative and quantitative results. However, PCR results may not reflect the infectivity of
the samples since PCR only detects the genes of the pathogens;
therefore, integrated cell culture-PCR (ICC-PCR) was developed to identify the specific infectious enteric viruses. ICCPCR has been used to detect infectious enteric viruses in river
water, tap water, beach water, and wastewater effluent samples
(28, 29, 39, 50). However, Buffalo green monkey (BGM) cell
culture, currently recommended by the EPA, has been compared with other cell lines, such as A549 and PLC/PRC/5 (28,

Over the last decade, thousands of people in the United
States have been infected with waterborne diseases, a large
number of whom were hospitalized. Most of the waterborne
disease outbreaks in the United States that occurred between
1991 and 2004 were related to microbial agents, i.e., viruses,
bacteria, and parasites (5, 30). The majority of the outbreaks
involved unidentified agents, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspects that many of the outbreaks due to
unidentified sources were caused by enteric viruses (46). Indeed, viruses have a high potential for groundwater pollution
due to their small size and low die-off rates. The occurrence of
enteric viruses in groundwater has been reported (1, 7, 12, 17).
In the United States, approximately 5.6 million dry tons of
biosolids are generated annually and 60% of the biosolids are
applied to land (36).
Several studies have reported the occurrence of enteric viruses in biosolids (18, 35, 47); however, information on the
quantity and infectivity of enteric viruses in biosolids is still
limited, and most studies focused solely on enteroviruses (41).
Few studies have reported the levels of human adenoviruses
(HAdV) in biosolids (6, 47), and no quantitative results have
yet been reported on some of the emerging viruses, such as

39), and the results showed that enteric viruses were propagated better with these cell lines than with BGM cells.
The main objective of this work was to investigate the occurrence and the quantitative levels of the enteric viruses in
class B mesophilic anaerobically digested (MAD) biosolid
samples by molecular and cell culture methods. These results
can be used for risk assessment at biosolid application sites.
Also, enteric viruses have been suggested as fecal source tracking indicators (21, 32), and the levels of enteric viruses in
biosolids reported in this study would be useful for the determination of which enteric virus is a better fecal source tracking
indicator at biosolid application sites. MAD biosolids were
chosen since they are the most common type of class B biosolid
produced in the United States (47). Three dewatered biosolid
samples were also included for comparison purposes. The levels of human adenovirus (HAdV), adenovirus type 40/41
(HAdV 40/41), enterovirus (EV), norovirus GI (NV GI) and
NV GII, human polyomavirus (HPyV), and hepatitis A virus
(HAV) were quantified by qPCR methods. BGM and A549
cell lines were used to quantify the infectious viruses in the
biosolids, and the effectiveness of these two cell lines’ ability to
propagate infectious viruses was compared. The occurrence of
infectious EV and HAdV in biosolids was determined by ICCPCR, and the serotypes of the infectious adenoviruses propagated on A549 were further determined. The levels of pathogen indicators and Salmonella enterica are also presented in
this study.

to 20 g (dry) biosolids and stirred for 30 min to elute the viruses. Then, the solids
were spun down by centrifugation and the supernatant was kept for further
concentration. The supernatant was flocculated by adjusting the pH to 3.5 and
spun again to form a pellet. The pellet was then dissolved in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and filtered through a 0.22-␮m filter. The final eluent was kept in
a ⫺80°C freezer for further analysis.
Indicators and Salmonella enterica analysis. All of the samples were analyzed
immediately after they were delivered to the laboratory. The indicators included
in this study were fecal coliform (FC) bacteria, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and
somatic phages. FC analysis was performed according to U.S. EPA method 1680
(44). E. coli and enterococci were analyzed by IDEXX methods (2, 4). Somatic
phages were analyzed by the double layer agar method (43). Each of the indicator measurements were run in triplicate for each sample. Salmonella enterica
was measured according to EPA method 1682 (45). All dilutions were made with
sterilized phosphate-buffered water.
Nucleic acid extraction. The virus eluent and cell culture supernatant were
extracted by using a MagNA Pure automatic extraction machine (Roche), and
the extraction kits used were MagNA Pure compact nucleic acid isolation kits,
large volume (Roche). One milliliter of the sample was extracted, and the final
elution volume was 100 ␮l. The nucleic acid (NA) eluents were stored in a ⫺80°C
freezer for molecular analysis.
The NA extraction efficiency was evaluated, and the method used was adapted
from previous studies (38, 47). NA extraction efficiencies for dewatered and
MAD biosolids were evaluated for all the biosolid samples. Amounts of 6.2 ⫻ 102
PFU of bovine enteroviruses (BEV) (ATCC VR-754) were spiked into the
biosolid eluent and NA-free water. After extraction, the levels of BEV were

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling. Biosolid samples were collected from five different wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) in Michigan, with three different sampling events at
each plant. Four of the plants produced class B MAD biosolids, and one of the
plants produced nondigested (dewatered) biosolids. A total of 12 MAD and
three dewatered biosolid samples were collected from December 2008 to September 2009. Approximately one or two samples were collected each month
during the study period. The class B biosolids are applied in agricultural plots,
and the dewatered biosolids are disposed to the local landfill. Table 1 displays the
stabilization temperatures, solid retention time, and dewatering processes of
each plant for producing biosolids. Two-liter grab samples of each of the anaerobically digested samples were collected from the postdigestion holding tanks
and then transferred or shipped to the laboratory on ice overnight. The dewatered samples were collected from the exiting conveyor belt in the loading bay.
Upon acquisition of the sample, all indicator tests, Salmonella enterica tests,
gravimetric analysis for determination of the solid contents, and viral elution/
concentration of each sample were performed immediately.
Virus elution process. Figure 1 shows a flow chart describing the methodology
applied to virus determination. The virus elution and concentration were performed according to ASTM D 4994-89 (3). Briefly, beef extract was added to 10

determined by qPCR. The extraction efficiency was calculated by dividing the
BEV RNA recovered from the biosolid matrix by the BEV RNA recovered from
the NA-free water. BEV was chosen since no samples tested positive for BEV.
The extraction efficiency was incorporated into the calculation of virus concentration in the biosolid samples.
qPCR standards. The concentrations of the target pathogens in the biosolid
samples were quantified by using the standard curves generated from ATCC
viruses or environmental isolates. Human adenovirus 40 (ATCC VR-930), Coxsackie virus B5 (ATCC VR-1036AS/MK), hepatitis A virus HM175 (ATCC
VR-1402), polyomavirus JC (JCPyV) (ATCC VR-1583), Salmonella enterica
(ATCC 14028), and norovirus isolates provided by Ingham County Health Department were used to generate the standard curves.
PCR amplicons of the target gene from HAdV, HPyV, and Salmonella enterica
and cDNA of the target gene from EV, BEV, NV, and HAV were cloned into
plasmid vectors according to the one-shot chemical transformation described in
the manufacturer’s instructions (TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmids carrying the cloned target gene were purified using
a Wizard Plus SV minipreps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI)
and sent for sequencing at the Research Technology Support Facility at Michigan State University. The target gene sequences were compared with those
published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).
The gene equivalent copies (GEC) of the standard stocks were quantified
using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and then 10-fold serially diluted.
The dilutions ranged from 101 to 108 GEC/real-time PCR (qPCR) reaction
mixture volume and were used to calibrate the concentration of the target

gene detected in the qPCR assays. The efficiency for each standard curve is
illustrated in Table 2.
qPCR assays. All qPCR assays were performed in a Roche LightCycler 1.5
instrument (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Each target in each
sample was run in triplicate qPCRs for determination. All PCR runs included a
negative control (PCR-grade H2O without template) and a positive-control reaction mixture. The crossing point of each PCR was automatically determined by
the LightCycler software, version 4.0, and used to calculate the genomic copies.
All of the primer and probe sequences are summarized in Table 2. Each qPCR
mixture included 10 ␮l of 2⫻ LightCycler 480 TaqMan master mix, an appropriate volume of primers and probes to obtain the concentration described in
Table 2, 5 ␮l of DNA or cDNA sample, and an appropriate volume of PCRgrade water to make up a final reaction mixture volume of 20 ␮l. The real-time
PCR running program (all thermocycles were performed at a temperature transition rate of 20°C/s) was 95°C for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation,
annealing, and extension (temperatures and times are listed in Table 2). All
reactions ended with a final cooling step at 40°C for 30 s.
Reverse transcription was required before the qPCR on EV, BEV, HAV, and
NV. Each reverse transcription reaction mixture included 2.5 ␮l of 10 ␮M
reverse primer, 1 ␮l of reverse transcriptase (Promega), 4 ␮l of 5⫻ Transcriptor
reaction buffer (Roche), 20 U of Protector RNase inhibitor (Roche), and 2 ␮l of
10 mM deoxynucleotide (Roche). The reaction conditions for all three RNA
viruses were the same; the reaction mixture was incubated at 55°C for 30 min and
then at 85°C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme.
To evaluate the presence of inhibition in the biosolid extracts, 104 copies of
BEV RNA were spiked into each biosolid NA extract at different dilutions (no

dilution, 1:5 dilution, and blank control consisting of NA-free water). The BEV
threshold cycle values of each biosolid NA extract with no dilution and with the
1:5 dilution were compared with the one in the blank control. If the threshold
cycle value of the blank control was 5% lower than that of the biosolid NA
extract with no dilution, it indicated that inhibition was present, and dilution of
the biosolid NA extract was performed until no inhibition was observed.
The limit of quantification was defined previously as the lowest concentration
of the target gene remaining within the linear range of quantification (38). Ten
copies of the virus gene was the limit of quantification for all qPCR assays used
in this study. Even though ⬍10 copies of the virus gene were detected in some
assays, the signals were not consistent. Therefore, we set 10 copies as our qPCR
detection limit, and the gene levels of the samples that tested negative were
calculated using 10 copies per qPCR.
Cell culture and ICC-PCR assay. Cell culture was performed on 10 biosolid
samples (two samples from each WWTP) to determine their infectivity levels.
Two cell lines, BGM (passage 140 to 170, obtained from Shay Fout at the EPA)
and A549 (passage 100 to 130, obtained from ATCC [CCL 185]), were used to
culture the viruses in biosolids. Briefly, the cells were grown in flasks until
reaching at least 80 to 90% confluence. Virus eluents with different serial 10-fold
dilutions were added to multiple culture flasks at each dilution and incubated at
36.5 ⫾ 1°C for 1 h with rocking every 15 min to ensure complete contact between
the cells and viral particles. Cells were maintained with minimum essential
medium (MEM) supplemented with L-glutamine, Earle’s salts, and 2% fetal
bovine serum. Cytopathic effects (CPE; indicative of a viral infection) in the cell
cultures were monitored for up to 14 days. All flasks that displayed CPE were
frozen at ⫺80°C for confirmation (second passage). The confirmation was done
by inoculating aliquots of 1 ml of the supernatant into new 80-to-90%-confluent
flasks and incubating for 7 days at 36.5 ⫾ 1°C. The CPE in each flask was
recorded, and the mean viral concentrations of the samples were estimated with
free most-probable-number (MPN) software downloaded from http://www
.i2workout.com/mcuriale/mpn/index.html. The results were expressed as MPN/4
g (dry), and only one MPN value was obtained for each sample due to the high
labor intensiveness of replication of MPN cell culture experiments. The positive
flasks were then frozen at ⫺80°C for ICC-PCR assay. The primers/probes of the
total HAdV and EV assays described in Table 2 were used for the ICC-PCR
assay to determine the occurrence of infectious HAdV and EV in the biosolid
samples. ICC-PCR assays were carried out on all flasks for the samples that had
no flasks displaying CPE after first passage.
PCR primers developed by Xu et al. (51) were used to further classify the
infectious HAdV species in A549-positive samples. The PCR amplification conditions were 94°C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 60 s, 54°C for 45 s,
72°C for 2 min, and finally, 5 min at 72°C. A total reaction mixture volume of 50
␮l consisted of 1 ␮l each of the 10 ␮M primers, 25 ␮l of Promega 2⫻ master mix
(Promega, WI), 18 ␮l of molecular-grade water, and 5 ␮l of DNA sample.
Statistical analysis. All microbial data were log10 transformed before the
statistical analysis since it was determined by the Anderson Darling test that the
data were log-normally distributed. To determine significant differences between
the concentrations of indicators and enteric viruses, an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) single-factor test was performed using SPSS, version 17.0. P values of
less than 0.05 indicate a significant difference.

RESULTS
Indicators and Salmonella enterica levels in biosolids. Figure
2 illustrates the indicator levels in the biosolids. All of the
indicator levels in the MAD biosolids were around 104 MPN or
PFU per gram, and no significant difference between each
indicator was observed (P ⱖ 0.05). Only 1 out of 12 MAD
samples exceeded the U.S. EPA regulatory limits for class B
biosolids (2 ⫻ 106 CFU/g). The dewatered biosolids had significantly higher levels of all four indicators than the MAD
biosolids (P ⱕ 0.05). The log differences between dewatered
and MAD biosolid samples were 3.56, 3.06, 1.74, and 0.81 for
FC bacteria, E. coli, enterococci, and somatic phages, respectively.
Six MAD and one dewatered sample were tested for Salmonella enterica. The only two MAD samples that tested positive
were from the St. Clair WWTP and had concentrations of only
0.487 and 0.954 MPN/4 g. However, the dewatered sample had
a much higher level of Salmonella enterica, which was 976
MPN/4 g. All seven samples were also tested by qPCR, but
none of the samples tested positive.
Nucleic acid extraction efficiency and inhibition control. No
inhibition was observed in any of the 15 biosolid extracts, since
the difference between the threshold cycle values of the blank
control and the biosolid NA extract with no dilution, as well as
the biosolid NA extract with a 1:5 dilution, were less than 5%.
The NA extraction efficiencies for dewatered and MAD biosolids were 31.0 ⫾ 10.4% (mean ⫾ standard deviation) and
80.0 ⫾ 35.2%, respectively.
Gene levels of enteric viruses in biosolids. Figure 3 and
Table 3 illustrate the average gene levels of enteric viruses and
the percentages of qPCR- and cell culture-positive samples in
both types of biosolid samples. The levels of HAdV were
significantly higher than the levels of other enteric viruses (P ⱕ
0.005), and they were detected more frequently than other
enteric viruses. The levels of HAdV were at least 0.71 and 2.0
logs higher than the levels of other enteric viruses in the MAD
and dewatered biosolids, respectively. The average level and
percentage of positive samples of HAdV in the MAD biosolids
were 7.5 ⫻ 105 copies/g and 83%, respectively. No significant
differences were observed among the levels of EV, NV, and

HPyV (P ⱖ 0.05) in both types of biosolids. No HAV was
detected in any of the samples. The levels of NV GI and NV
GII were 5.0 ⫻ 104 and 1.5 ⫻ 105 copies/g in the MAD
biosolids, which is comparable to the levels of EV. NV was
detected more frequently than EV in the MAD samples. Both
HPyV and HAdV are double-stranded DNA viruses, but the
levels of HPyV (7.4 ⫻ 104 and 2.5 ⫻ 105 copies/g for the MAD
and dewatered samples, respectively) were lower than the levels of HAdV and HPyV was detected less frequently. Only the
levels of HAdV and EV in dewatered samples were significantly higher than their levels in MAD samples (P ⱕ 0.05).
Infectivity of enteric viruses. Figure 4 illustrates the average
MPN levels of biosolids determined in both cell lines. The
results showed that the MPN levels using A549 cells were
significantly higher than the levels determined using BGM cells
(P ⱕ 0.005). The mean levels of infectious viruses in MAD
biosolids were 2.9 and 480 MPN/4 g on BGM and A549 cells,
respectively. The mean levels in dewatered biosolids were 67
and 2,210 MPN/4 g on BGM and A549, respectively. CPE was
observed in all samples on A549 cells, but CPE was observed in
only 50% of the MAD samples on BGM cells (Table 3). With
the exception of one dewatered sample, all nine samples had
higher MPN counts when propagated on A549 cells. There was
no significant difference between MPN values of dewatered
and MAD samples propagated on both types of cell lines.
Table 4 illustrates the ICC-PCR results for HAdV and EV
in flasks of BGM and A549 cells. Infectious HAdV and EV
were detected in 70% and 10% of the A549 cell-propagated
samples, respectively. No infectious HAdV was found in any of
the BGM cell-propagated samples, but infectious EV was
found in 30% of the BGM cell-propagated samples. Infectious
HAdV and EV were found in both dewatered samples. Seventy-five percent and 12.5% of the MAD samples were positive
for infectious HAdV and EV, respectively. Interestingly, both
HAdV qPCR-negative samples were also ICC-PCR HAdV
negative in both cell lines (Table 4). The other ICC-PCR
HAdV-negative sample on A549 cells [Plainwell (8/4/2009)]
also had a relatively lower HAdV gene concentration. All of
the flasks with no CPE tested negative by both HAdV and EV
ICC-PCR.

cell flasks are listed in Table 5. The HAdV species detected
were A (f ⫽ 4) (f is frequency of detection), B (f ⫽ 3), C (f ⫽

DISCUSSION
Land application of biosolids has been practiced increasingly
worldwide since it has the benefit of reducing the environmental contamination by reuse of the biosolids and provides biosolids as an additional source of nutrients to agricultural fields
(41). However, there is a growing concern over whether landapplied biosolids would pose a risk of groundwater and/or
surface water contamination. Microorganisms generally tend
to attach to solid surfaces (31). Therefore, the majority of
viruses and other pathogens in wastewater utilities are likely
associated with sludge particles and are expected to end up in
waste sludge. The most common class B sludge treatment in
the United States is mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD).
The results of a previous study suggested that viruses are resistant to MAD treatment (47). The information provided in
this study provides a better understanding of the quantity and
infectivity levels of several of the most critical emerging viruses
in MAD biosolids measured by both molecular and cell culture
methods.
The higher indicator levels in dewatered versus MAD biosolids were expected since the only treatment of dewatered
biosolids is to lower the moisture content. The log reduction of
FC bacteria between dewatered and MAD samples was greater
than the reduction of somatic phages. This observation was
similar to previous findings, where FC bacteria had a greater
reduction than male-specific phages between class A and B
biosolids (47). A similar trend was also observed in our previous study of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor that treats
animal waste (49). The log reduction of E. coli by anaerobic
digestion was 1.5, but the log reduction for somatic phages was
only 0.5. Also, no significant difference was observed between
the enteric virus levels in dewatered and MAD samples by both
molecular and cell culture measurements (except for total
HAdV and EV by qPCR). These findings showed that anaerobic digestion may be effective for the removal of bacterial
indicators but not for viruses. Lower levels of Salmonella enterica in the MAD biosolids were expected since previous stud-

Samples from East Lansing were dewatered biosolids; samples from St. Clair, Plainwell, Romeo, and Traverse City were MAD biosolids.

ies also found that the Salmonella enterica concentrations in
the MAD biosolids were several orders of magnitude lower
than the indicator concentrations (10, 19). Low-level occurrences of Salmonella enterica in the MAD biosolids were also
observed in the previous study, where Gantzer et al. (19) found
only 55% of the MAD samples to be positive for Salmonella
enterica.
The levels and occurrence of HAdV measured in this study
were comparable to the results of 5.0 ⫻ 105 copies/g and 88%
reported by Viau and Peccia (47). The average HAdV levels of
MAD biosolids reported by Bofill-Mas et al. (6) were 103
copies/g, which was approximately 2 logs lower than the HAdV
levels observed in this study. The higher levels of HAdV than
of other enteric viruses in biosolids could be due to its high
resistance to treatment processes and high concentrations in
wastewater. Enriquez and Gerba (15) conducted a survival
study of HAdV 40/41 in tap water, seawater, and wastewater
and concluded that HAdV 40/41 is more stable than poliovirus
in tap water and wastewater. Irving and Smith (22) reported
that HAdV are more likely to survive the conventional sewage
treatment than EV. Katayama et al. (26) found that HAdV had
the highest levels during a 1-year survey of NV, EV, and
HAdV in six WWTPs.
The average levels of EV in the MAD biosolids were 1.9 ⫻
104 copies/g, which is also comparable to the 1.2 ⫻ 104 copies/g
reported by Monpoeho et al. (34); however, EV were detected
in all of their MAD samples, but only 42% of the samples were
detected as positive in this study. The qPCR assay used in this
study was adapted from Dierssen et al. (14), and it is different
than the one used in the previous study, where their assay was

adapted from Monpoeho et al. (33). However, we think the
difference in occurrence frequency is likely due to the lower
levels of EV in our MAD biosolid samples rather than the use
of a different qPCR assay. A comparison study between these
two assays that was run in our laboratory for selected samples
indicated that the assay developed by Dierssen et al. (14)
resulted in higher virus quantities and more frequent detection
than the one by Monpoeho et al. (33).
NV is an emerging virus and is one of the causes of gastroenteritis disease worldwide. NV has been detected and quantified in raw sewage and treated effluent (11, 20, 26, 27). However, no quantitative results of NV in biosolids have been
reported prior to this study. Even though the levels of NV were
not as high as the levels of HAdV, they were comparable to the
levels of EV and HPyV. The occurrence levels were also significant, where at least 50% of the MAD samples were found
to contain either NV GI or NV GII. NV GII had about halfa-log higher concentrations and 25% more positive samples
than NV GI in the MAD biosolids. This observation is similar
to the results of previous studies where NV GII was found
more abundantly than NV GI in raw sewage (11, 20, 26).
The HPyV levels of MAD biosolids reported by Bofill-Mas
et al. (6) were between 103 and 104 copies/g (dry), and all of
their biosolid samples were positive for HPyV. The mean
HPyV level of our MAD biosolids was 5.91 ⫻ 104 copies/g,
which is comparable to the previous findings. However, only
58% of our biosolid samples were positive for HPyV. The
difference in occurrence frequency between these two studies
may be due to our MAD biosolids being collected from several
different treatment plants, since HPyV was detected in all of
the samples from the St. Clair and Romeo WWTPs but only
one sample was positive in all of the Plainwell and Traverse
City samples. The positive samples in this study, however, had
higher concentrations, ranging from 2.41 ⫻ 105 to 1.18 ⫻ 106
copies/g. This may be due to the nature of our samples, or it
could be due to the qPCR assay used in this study, which could
target two main types of HPyV (polyomaviruses JC and BK
[JCPyV and BKPyV]), whereas the assay used in the previous
study mainly targets JCPyV.
Even though some studies have reported the presence of
HAV in environmental water media (8, 13, 40, 48), no HAV
was detected in any of our biosolid samples. The occurrence of

VOL. 76, 2010

HAV indicates that the risk of transporting HAV from landapplied biosolids to the natural environment is minimal.
The cell culture MPN results indicated that A549 cells were
more susceptible to biosolid-associated viruses than BGM
cells. Interestingly, the ICC-PCR results showed that infectious
HAdV was present in more samples than infectious EV, and
the infectious HAdV was only found in A549 cell-propagated
samples. Also, the qPCR results showed a higher quantitative
level and occurrence frequency of HAdV than of EV. Previous
studies compared BGM with A549 cells and showed that the
BGM cell line was not effective in propagating HAdV (30). We
have also tested the effectiveness of propagating ATCC HAdV
(serotypes 4, 6, 21, 31, 36, 40, and 41) in BGM and A549 cells
(data not shown). The results showed that all seven serotypes
of HAdV propagated using A549 cells, but only serotype 6
propagated using BGM cells. Based on these facts, we believe
that the infectious HAdV levels are higher than the infectious
EV levels in the biosolid samples and that BGM cells not being
able to propagate the infectious HAdV effectively resulted in a
lower infectious unit. Most of the previous studies used BGM
cells to evaluate the viral infectivity in biosolids (33, 34, 35, 41).
However, most of the recent findings have shown that HAdV
are more prevalent than EV in environmental samples. Therefore, HAdV could be a more suitable enteric virus for use as an
indicator of human fecal pollution at biosolid application sites.
HAdV species A (HAdV-A), B, C, and D were detected in
the positive ICC-PCR samples. In a previous study (28), the
infectious HAdV species in river water detected using A549
cells were C (f ⫽ 7), D (f ⫽ 5), A (f ⫽ 4), and F (f ⫽ 1). No
species B or E was detected. HAdV-A, -C, and -D were detected in the previous study as well as this one. HAdV-F (type
40 and 41) was detected by qPCR in biosolids, and the levels
were relatively high compared to the levels of other enteric
viruses. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we have done
a study on the propagation of different ATCC HAdV species in
A549 cells, and species F (both type 40 and 41) had the least
increase in concentration compared to the other HAdV species after 1 week of incubation. Therefore, we think it is likely
that there was infectious HAdV-F in the biosolids but that
other HAdV species may have outgrown the HAdV-F, which
resulted in no detection of HAdV-F during ICC-PCR.
Conclusions. Currently, monitoring the occurrence of EV in
biosolids is suggested by the EPA. However, the results from
this study showed that HAdV had the highest gene levels
compared to other enteric viruses in biosolids. Infectious
HAdV was detected more frequently than infectious EV.
Therefore, more studies on the inactivation of HAdV by different sludge treatment processes should be carried out since
high levels of HAdV still remained in the MAD biosolids.
More cell lines which are susceptible to HAdV should also be
investigated. This study provided quantitative levels of NV in
biosolids, which has never been reported in the published literature. There is a need to conduct more studies on the occurrence of NV in different types of biosolids since significant
levels of NV were found. Finally, low levels of HAV and
Salmonella enterica in biosolids may suggest that the risk of
water contamination by these pathogens from biosolid application sites would be minimal.
